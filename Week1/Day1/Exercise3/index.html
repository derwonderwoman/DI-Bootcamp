    <article>
        <p>"Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known
            <br> as the Asgardians, a group of humanoid beings from the pocket
            <br> dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.Thor is the son of Odin,
            <br> the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans
            <br> known as Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with 
            <br> his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir, which helps him to channel his 
            <br>godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. 
            <br>When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, 
            <br>Odin sent him to Midgard (more commonly known as Earth) as a 
            <br> disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,stripped of his
            <br> memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as 
            <br> his godly powers. Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as 
            <br> well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</p>
